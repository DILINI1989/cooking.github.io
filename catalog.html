		“This is probably the most well-known Chinese chicken dish outside of 
		China,” Yinn Low says. “It’s also an authentic and traditional dish that 
		you can find in many restaurants in China.” The spicy stir-fried chicken 
		dish originates from the Sichuan province of southwestern China, and 
		while you’ve probably had the Westernized version, the real thing is 
		fragrant, spicy and a little bit mouth-numbing, thanks to Sichuan 
		peppercorns. If you want to avoid the Americanized copycat, Yinn Low 
		says the O.G. is actually quite easy to recreate at home.<br />

		“Personally, I think Peking duck is the best way to eat duck,” Yinn Low 
		tells us of the Beijing dish. “Crispy roasted duck sliced into 
		bite-sized pieces, rolled up in a wrapper with salad and hoisin sauce.” 
		Peking duck is seasoned, dried for 24 hours and cooked in an open-air 
		oven called a hung oven, so it’s not something you can really replicate 
		at home...but it is something we recommend seeking out at a traditional 
		Chinese restaurant. (It’s traditionally carved and served in three 
		courses: skin, meat and bones in the form of broth, with sides like 
		cucumbers, bean sauce and pancakes).<br />

		<br />
		Maybe you’ve heard of or even tried mapo tofu, but Westernized versions 
		of the Sichuanese tofu/beef/fermented bean paste dish are usually much 
		less spicy than their traditional counterpart, which is laden with chile 
		oil and Sichuan peppercorns. Fun fact: The literal translation of the 
		name is “pockmarked old woman’s bean curd,” thanks to origin stories 
		that claim it was invented by, well, a pockmarked old woman. It’s got a 
		little bit of everything: textural contrast, bold flavors and lots of 
		heat.<br />

		“Wontons are one of the most authentic Chinese dumplings,” Yinn Low 
		says. The wontons themselves are made with a thin, square dumpling 
		wrapper and can be filled with proteins such as shrimp, pork, fish or a 
		combination, depending on the region (Yinn Low’s recipe calls for 
		shrimp). The broth is a rich concoction of pork, chicken, Chinese ham 
		and aromatics, and you’ll often find cabbage and noodles mingling with 
		the wontons</td>
